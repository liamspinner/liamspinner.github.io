    <h1>Liam Spinner</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Liam. I'm an undergraduate student at University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida.</p>
    <h2>My Interests and Aspirations</h2>
    <p>My interests and professional aspirations are at the intersection of civil engineering, city infrastructure and 
      planning, computer science and entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>I believe computer technology is increasingly becoming the foundation of the city's infrastructure. The
      future city will seamlessly integrate physical urban infrastructure with digital infrastructure, particularly AI
      and cybersecurity. This will enable better designed cities and deliver safes, more secure, more efficient,
      cost effective and sustainable communities to power our lives.</p>
    
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>Currently, I'm an undergraduate student with a major in computer science. In addition, I have completed
      coursework related to civil engineering, construction, aviation and business.</p>
    
    <p>With a group of student colleagues, I created a start-up business in the air taxi industry. We are ahead of
      the times as the FAA is still to put regulatory guidelines out in order for us to move our business forward.
      There is much potential here for public-private partnership to create an infrastructural network to support
      the air taxi market in the future.</p>

    <p>In addition, I've been a research assistant in the High Energy Particle Lab at Florida Institute of Technology</p>

    <p>Finally, as side projects I have been working on computer vision projects, specifically focused on
      visualizing vehicle and pedestrian traffic. There's tremendous potential applications that I will continue to
      develop.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>After graduation I hope to land a position where I will be able to integrate my computer science
      knowledge to solve city planning problems and improve the way we live and work in our communities.</p>
